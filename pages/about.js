                <p>My photographic eye and merchandising creativity, combined with exemplary customer service and sales expertise, translate to a skill set that will help build revenue for your shop. In 2.5 years at a private North Shore club, I recently contributed to annual sales growth of more than 20% via bringing in seven new lines and countless
                    accessories. Currently, I work with eight North Shore golf shops and recently I supervised the Après Golf Shop at the 2024 BMW Championship (Castle Pines) and designed and merchandised the Icehouse Specialty Shop at the 2023 BMW Championship. I want to help you build your shop and your sales to meet the needs of your members. A superior shopping experience for everyone who walks through your door is my steadfast goal.
